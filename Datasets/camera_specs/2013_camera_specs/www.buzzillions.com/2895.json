        "The high resolution of 8 megapixels in the sleek flat body lets you crop and enlarge faces and parts of scenes and still enjoy smooth tones and images.&nbsp; You just frame the shot, and Face Detection does the work, simultaneously and accurately finding up to 10 faces for bright, clear results.\nNo more shots spoiled by blur from camera shake or moving subjects! High sensitivity lets you use a fast shutter to freeze the action in sharp bright detail, while built-in CCD shift image stabilization automatically compensates for camera shake.&nbsp; Share beautiful images with Blog mode, Wireless Communication, and slideshow functions.\nEven more fun after you press the shutter!",

The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels, each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has, the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand, the megapixels determine the size of the print, so higher megapixels means larger print sizes, for examples, 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints, 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints.",

The higher the megapixels, the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take, and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print-quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers.",

Compact and Ultra-compact are light, pocket-sized cameras that are easy to carry, usually with a built-in lens. Standard point-and-shoot cameras are of medium size, usually come with a built-in lens, and have basic features that are useful for the casual photographer. SLR/Professional cameras are usually larger, but offer more advanced features and detachable lenses for the photography enthusiast or professional.",

    "white balance": "Auto\nThe shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables: the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter, opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually, a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene, for motion shots, while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused, abstract result.",

All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts, so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance, the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue, green or orange hues.",

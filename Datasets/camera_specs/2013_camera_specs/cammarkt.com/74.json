Though digital cameras don't use film, they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions, adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe, ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA (American Standards Association).

    "white balance": "Auto\nThe shutter speed of a camera depends on two variables: the size of the lens and the actual timing of the shutter, opening and closing. These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually, a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene, for motion shots, while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused, abstract result.",

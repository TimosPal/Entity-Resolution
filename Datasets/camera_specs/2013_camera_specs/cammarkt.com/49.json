    "image sensor type": "CMOS\nResolution is measured in megapixels. The higher the megapixels, the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take, and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print-quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers.",

        "1.2 lb.\nThe sensor in a digital camera is composed of pixels, which are tiny light-sensitive squares. The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels, each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has, the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand, the megapixels determine the size of the print, so higher megapixels means larger print sizes, for examples, 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints, 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints.",

The sensors in most cameras today are made up of millions of pixels, each one registering the brightness of the light striking it as the photo is taken. A megapixel is the term used for a million pixels \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the more megapixels an imaging sensor has, the higher the camera's potential resolution. On the other hand, the megapixels determine the size of the print, so higher megapixels means larger print sizes, for examples, 6 megapixels are good for 8 x 10 in. prints, 8 megapixels are good for 16 x 20 in. prints.",

It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light (based on an arithmetical progression). Though digital cameras don't use film, they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions, adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe, ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA (American Standards Association). Generally, with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.",
    "frames per second": "4.5 Frames\nThe white balance of a digital camera controls the color outcome of pictures. All light gives off a color temperature which the camera analyzes and internally adjusts, so that the colors of the picture are captured in their true form. Without the proper white balance, the color in a photo may contain an overabundance of blue, green or orange hues.",

The higher the megapixels, the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take, and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print-quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers.",

Compact and Ultra-compact are light, pocket-sized cameras that are easy to carry, usually with a built-in lens. Standard point-and-shoot cameras are of medium size, usually come with a built-in lens, and have basic features that are useful for the casual photographer. SLR/Professional cameras are usually larger, but offer more advanced features and detachable lenses for the photography enthusiast or professional.",

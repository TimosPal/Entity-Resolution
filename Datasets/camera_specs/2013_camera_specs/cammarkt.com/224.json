It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light (based on an arithmetical progression). Though digital cameras don't use film, they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions, adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe, ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA (American Standards Association). Generally, with higher ISO speeds there is more noise.",

The higher the megapixels, the sharper and more detailed the pictures your digital camera can take, and the bigger you can enlarge them without losing the sharpness of the image. 3.1 megapixels and higher is usually considered sufficient for print-quality photos. Photos with a resolution of less than 3.1 megapixels are best viewed only on computers.",

Compact and Ultra-compact are light, pocket-sized cameras that are easy to carry, usually with a built-in lens. Standard point-and-shoot cameras are of medium size, usually come with a built-in lens, and have basic features that are useful for the casual photographer. SLR/Professional cameras are usually larger, but offer more advanced features and detachable lenses for the photography enthusiast or professional.",

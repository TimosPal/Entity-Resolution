    "product information": "The EX-Z600 offers 6.0 megapixel high-resolution photos in a stylish, compact, and pocket-sized package. The extra large 2.7-inch Super Bright LCD is approximately three times brighter than the previous EX-Z500 model, producing an impressive luminance of 1200 candelas per square meter. This significant advancement makes the LCD easier to see, especially when viewed in the sunny outdoors. In auto mode, the LCD automatically adjusts to the brightness of the surrounding environment. The EX-Z600's Super Life Battery now has an even longer battery life, supporting a staggering 550 shots per charge. The EXILIM line is a culmination of CASIO's core technologies of miniaturization and digital technology resulting in a smaller, higher resolution camera - the established trend leader in stylish, quick responding, large LCD, and long battery life digital cameras. The EX-Z600 includes the latest version of the EXILIM Engine, featuring the Anti Shake DSP, which along with the Auto Macro and Quick Shutter functions, considerably reduces the incidence of blurred photos due to moving subjects or shaking hands. New to the EX-Z600 is the Rapid Flash function, which enables three consecutive high-speed flash photos in only one second, allowing you to completely capture the moment without losing precious seconds between shots. The EX-Z600 includes Revive Shot, used to take still images from old album photos for long-term preservation and enjoyment. Revive Shot digitally revives faded colors and automatically adjusts for obliquity, even when photos are shot while still in the album. The EX-Z600 is equipped with a BEST SHOT Button, allowing convenient one-touch access to this popular feature that offers 32 different scene selections, including Anti Shake and Revive Shot, for hassle-free photos every time. The EX-Z600 embodies CASIO's continuing commitment to offer digital camera users cutting-edge technology and convenient user-friendly functionality in a small, stylishly designed package. Providing the freedom to take high quality pictures and movies anywhere, anytime, the new EX-Z600 makes taking memories as easy and fun as making them.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCasio ModelEX-Z600 MPNEXZ600DBA\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom3x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution6.0 MP Screen Size2.7\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range15-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera38 - 114mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/2000 sec Min Shutter Speed4 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Multi-Segment, Spot Exposure ModesAutomatic, Program Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 50, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max400\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.15 m - 2.8 m Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator, Auto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction\nMemory / Storage Integrated Memory size8.3 MB Supported Flash MemoryBuilt-in, MultiMediaCard, SD Card, SD Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeNone, Without Viewfinder\nDimensions Depth0.81 in.

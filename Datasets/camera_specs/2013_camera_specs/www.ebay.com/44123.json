Create an expansive landscape one shot, a stunning close-up the next. But as powerful as the Coolpix P7700 is, you don't need to be a pro to excel with it.

    "fast operation and continuous shooting": "Life moves fast, but the COOLPIX P7700 keeps up. In an instant, it powers up, zooms in, autofocuses and captures stunning shot after shot. Hold down the shutter button and fire a blazing-fast 8 fps for some of the most impressive action-freezing sequences you've ever seen. Plus, every photo and video will be sharp and steady, even if your hands are not - Nikon's VR image stabilization ensures a little camera shake won't ruin the shot.",

    "categorybrand": "Nikon DF Silver DSLR Full Frame Camera Body Only\nOVERVIEWFEATURESDesigned to travel, the Df has the smallest and lightest body among Nikon FX-format models, and in pursuit of pleasurable operability, the camera body was designed with sharp angles on its exterior to accommodate the large mechanical dials. Photographers can easily take the camera anywhere and use it comfortably for longer periods of time. On top of that, the Df incorporates the same FX-format CMOS sensor and EXPEED 3 image-processing engine as the D4. Expect exceptionally versatile image quality ??from ISO 100 to 12800.\nUsing its large, metallic mechanical dials, photographers will rediscover a more direct connection with their camera. This is Nikon's smallest, lightest FX-format body, yet it delivers the same exceptional image quality as the D4 ??from low to extremely high ISO. The Df represents a fusion between tactile precision mechanics and the exquisite image quality of the flagship camera D4, stimulating artistic sensibilities and inspiring photographers to new levels of creativity beyond previous limitations of time, place and volume of available light. This is Nikon's proposal to passionate photographers: rediscover the fulfillment of measured, deliberate photography, and create your pictures one frame at a time.\nThe large mechanical dials on the top deck are carved from solid metal in order to allow more direct and purposeful exposure control. Photographers have easy access to a diverse array of innovative features, helping them create one-of-a-kind images. That's what the Df is built for: helping photographers relay their ideas more intuitively via mechanical dials, and then using cutting-edge innovations to produce the results they envisioned. With the Df, each frame becomes meaningful again.\nDirect, purposeful camera operation to inspire photographers\nFX format with 16.2-megapixel resolution: for photographers who roam\nDedicated to high-quality still photography\nTactile precision mechanics: one-of-a-kind images, all under your direct control\nIntuitive simplicity: the key to distilling your creativity\nPrecision design: the feel of elite operation\nIntimacy with your subject: glass pentaprism optical viewfinder with approx. 100% frame coverage\nCutting-edge innovation to further support intuitive camera operation\ni button for quick and direct access to various functions\nCompatible with non-AI NIKKOR lenses: exposure meter coupling also available by manual matching of the camera aperture setting to the lens\nAuthentic Nikon SLR design: the most portable of the FX-format D-SLRs\nThe quartet of true potential: NIKKOR, the Nikon FX-format image sensor and the EXPEED 3 image-processing engine of the D4, and Picture Control\nThe power to change your photography: flagship-quality images and ISO range in a more portable size\nPhotographic flexibility: Picture Control System, Active D-Lighting and HDR\nLightweight and ruggedly constructed body with dust-prevention and weather-resistance employing magnesium alloy\nHighly durable and precise shutter mechanisms tested for 150,000 cycles\nAF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G (Special Edition)\nINSIDE THE PACKAGENikon DF Silver DSLR Full Frame Camera Body Only * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.

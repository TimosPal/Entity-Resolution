    "product information": "The EXILIM CARD EX-S600 series is the next evolution in the popular line of ultra-slim card-sized high-resolution digital cameras of CASIO. In addition to 6 mega pixel photos, a major addition to this line is the EX-S600's ability to reduce camera shake instantaneously when recording quality MPEG-4 movies.The EX-S600's ability to take state-of-the-art movies instantly and easily adds to the versatility and fun of this powerful and high quality digital camera. The EX-S600 fits conveniently in any pocket to go wherever you go, ready to quickly capture special moments. No matter how spontaneous the situation, the EXILIM engine's Anti Shake DSP reduces blurring caused by shaky hands and/or moving subjects, and the Auto Macro and Quick Shutter functions ensure that photos are properly focused.In addition to enhanced resolution, the EX-S600's 3X zoom and increased battery life allowing up to 300 shots per battery charge provide significant photographic flexibility. The BEST SHOT menu includes the new Revive Shot, created specifically for taking digital pictures of old album photos. Revive Shot adjusts for obliquity as well as brightly refreshes faded colors. Whether framing a shot, reviewing images, or watching movies, everything is brighter when displayed on the adjustable 2.2 inch LCD-approximately twice as bright as previous models, making it ideal for outdoor use. Small enough to conveniently carry wherever you go, the EX-S600 has one-touch buttons that allow quick start up of the camera to view images and take pictures, as well as one for taking movies, all designed to quickly capture special moments. The EX-S600 connects easily to a TV or PC via the multi cradle, which also doubles as the battery charger.The EX-S600 continues the EXILIM CARD tradition of offering cutting-edge technology packed into a small, slim, and stylish body. With high quality photos, advanced movie recording capabilities, and a tremendous range of remarkable functions, CASIO once again exceeds expectations by providing a conveniently portable means of preserving memories to be cherished for a lifetime.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCasio ModelEX-S600 MPNEX-S600BE\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom3x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution6.0 MP Screen Size2.2\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range15-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Manual Focus, Automatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera38 - 114mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/2000 sec Min Shutter Speed4 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Multi-Segment, Spot Exposure ModesAutomatic, Program Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 1600, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 50, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max1600\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.4 m - 2.8 m Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator, Auto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction\nMemory / Storage Integrated Memory size8.3 MB Supported Flash MemoryMultiMediaCard, SD Card, SD Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeNone, Without Viewfinder\nDimensions Depth0.63 in.

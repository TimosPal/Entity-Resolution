    "4x antiblur": "4x anti-blur automatically counters blurred images in four different ways. Electronic VR (Vibration Reduction) reduces the effect of camera shake. High ISO (up to 3200 at full size) light sensitivity reduces the risk of blurred images with fast-moving subjects or in low-light. Motion detection compensates for camera and subject movement. Best Shot Selector (BSS) automatically selects the sharpest of up to 10 sequential shots.",

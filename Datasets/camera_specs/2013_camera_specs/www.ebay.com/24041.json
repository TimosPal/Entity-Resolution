    "product information": "The DMC-FZ30's LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT lens features 14 elements in 8 groups, including 3 aspherical lenses and an ED (extra-low dispersion) lens which helps to suppress the color bleeding that often occurs in telephoto shots, plus a 12x optical zoom (35mm equivalent: 35 to 420mm). This combines with the large, 1/1.8\" diagonal 8-megapixel CCD to give you enormous expressive power. The new Extended Optical Zoom, which minimizes the image degradation that normally occurs with digital zooming, gives you up to 19.1x power in 3-megapixel photos, and up to 15x power in 5-megapixel photos. Plus, the 12x optical zoom can be used together with the 4x digital zoom to produce a maximum of 48x zooming power.In addition to five auto focus modes (1-point, 3-point high-speed, 9-point, spot AF, and 1-point high-speed AF), the FZ30 features a ring that lets you manually adjust the focus from 0.98 feet (0.3m) to infinity. It also has Manual Focus Assist, a function that shows an enlarged image of the subject's center in the viewfinder. The One-Shot AF function in manual focus mode lets you focus automatically for a single shot by pressing the \"FOCUS\" button. The Continuous AF function keeps moving subjects in sharp focus, and the AF Assist Lamp helps in dim lighting. This all adds up to easy, accurate focusing.Jitter from shaky hands is one of the main reasons why cameras produce blurry images. Lumix cameras help solve the problem of unsteady hands with advanced MEGA Optical Image Stabilizer technology. The DMC-FZ20K has a built-in gyrosensor that detects any hand movement and relays a signal to a tiny microcomputer inside the camera, which instantly calculates the compensation needed. A linear motor then shifts the Optical Image Stabilizer lens as necessary to guide incoming light from the image straight to the CCD. You won't even notice it working - all you'll see are the outstanding results!The manual focus ring lets you focus on whatever part of your subject you wish, and the zoom ring lets you zoom in and out easily and accurately as you compose the perfect shot. They're both fast, so you can capture moving subjects in your composition.Change the angle of the high-resolution 230, 000-pixel 2.0\" diagonal LCD monitor any way you like. You get the flexibility to catch a high-angle shot over a crowd, or a low-angle shot of flowers in a garden, all with a comfortable posture.You can snap off consecutive shots at 3 frames per second with full resolution. In addition, the Unlimited Consecutive Shooting function lets you continue shooting until the memory card is full.Regardless of the Mode Dial setting, you can take macro shots instantly by flicking the switch on the side of the lens to the AF Macro setting. This lets you get as close as 0.16 feet (5cm) from your subject (at the maximum wide-angle setting).\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandPanasonic ModelDMC-FZ30 MPNDMCFZ30S UPC0037988985197\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom12x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution8.0 MP Screen Size2\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/1.8\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range5cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Manual Focus, Automatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera35 - 420mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/2000 sec Min Shutter Speed60 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Multi-Segment, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 80, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max400\nCamera Flash Flash TypePop-up Flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.3 m - 7 m Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator, Auto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash, Slow Sync Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryMultiMediaCard, SD Card, SD Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeDigital, Electronic Viewfinder - Field Coverage100% Viewfinder Diagonal Size0.44\"\nDimensions Depth5.44 in.

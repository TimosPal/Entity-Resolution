    "product information": "Unlike competing cameras, the DSLR-A500L is just as responsive in Quick Auto Focus Live View mode as in optical viewfinder mode. That's because, unlike the others, the A500L uses the same \"phase detection\" auto focus for Live View as for the optical viewfinder. While other Live View systems are severely restricted, Sony's performs superbly any time - even if you're shooting handheld or chasing after moving subjects like kids or pets.Even if you're completely comfortable with the optical viewfinder, Sony's tiltable LCD empowers your photography with a different point of view. Helps you frame high and low-angle shots that would otherwise be hit or miss. The LCD tilts up or down 90 degrees to capture a child's first steps or shoot over a crowd. The 3.0\"LCD features 230,000 pixels and Sony's Clear Photo LCD display technology.High Dynamic Range (HDR) photography captures more scene contrast than a single exposure can handle by combining two exposures into one incredible shot. Until recently, you needed a computer and editing software to enjoy HDR. Now the A500L has Auto HDR built in. Handles severe backlighting and other high-contrast scenes. Captures in a split second.Connect your camera to a compatible HDTV and play back your images in stunning high definition. The A500L includes an HDMI output. In addition, the BRAVIA Sync system works with compatible Sony BRAVIA HDTVs to let you control camera playback using the television's remote.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandSony ModelDSLR-A500 MPNDSLRA500L\nKey Features Camera TypeDigital SLR Optical Zoom3x Sensor Resolution12.3 MP Screen Size3\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size15.6 x 23.5mm Sensor TypeCMOS, Exmor CMOS\nLens System Lens TypeZoom lens Lens For SDDT SAM 18-55mm Focal Length Range18mm - 55mm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic, Manual Lens Filter Size55 mm Lens System FeaturesSmooth Autofocus Motor (SAM) Auto Focus typeTTL phase detection\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/4000 sec Min Shutter Speed30 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure RangeEV 2-20 ( ISO 100 ) Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Multi-Segment, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Bulb, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 200-12800, ISO auto (200-1600) Light Sensitivity Max12800\nCamera Flash Flash TypePop-up Flash Red Eye ReductionYes Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator, Auto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Rear Sync Flash, Slow Sync, Wireless Off-Camera Control, flash exposure bracketing Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Rear Curtain Sync, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryMemory Stick DUO PRO, Memory Stick PRO Duo, Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo, SD Card, SD Memory Card, SDHC Card, SDHC Memory Card Floppy Drive StorageNone\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeOptical, Optical (Through-the-lens) Optical Viewfinder TypeEye-level penta-dach mirror Viewfinder - Field Coverage95% Viewfinder Magnification0.8x Dioptric Correction Range-2.5 to +1\nDimensions Depth3.31 in.

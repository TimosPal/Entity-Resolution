    "comprehensive protection": "Fait Spectacular images can be found far beyond the controlled confines of the studio. Unlike less robust 36x24mm D-SLRs or more cumbersome medium-format equipment, the D3X was designed to be at home both on the set and on location. Its performance-tested body is similar to the world-renowned D3, which has proven that it can withstand the worst of what the world's leading news photographers can throw at it. Wherever you are, the D3X delivers studio-quality images in an agile body that can withstand the elements.",

    "creative freedom": "Whether it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the world-renowned NIKKOR lenses or the industry-leading Speedlight system, shooting with a D3X opens the door to a range of creative opportunities that only Nikon can offer. The Nikon Total Imaging System, backed up by the Nikon Professional Services (NPS) network is there to help you realize your vision, or even stimulate new ones.",
    "exquisite details": "The sensor's 24.5 megapixels are only the beginning. No matter how you shoot - tightly controlled or on the fly - the camera's phenomenally wide dynamic range retains subtlety of shadow and highlight detail that contributes to breathtaking image fidelity, which can make the difference between good pictures and exceptional ones.",
    "images with the xfactor": "Images with the X-factor are what your clients expect and your reputation deserves. Nikon's EXPEED processing system is much more than a mere label or processing chip component. The EXPEED at work in the D3X is designed specifically to meet the requirements of a 24.5-megapixel sensor. The results will exceed the expectations of any photographer whose work requires extreme resolution, rich tonal gradation, outstanding color accuracy and remarkable detail. Commercial and fine art photographers will immediately see that the D3X cuts no corners.",

    "rapid response": "Not every subject poses for the camera. Whether it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s on the catwalk, in the studio or roaming in the wild, photographers must capture their subject beautifully and accurately. With its 51 individually selectable AF points, the D3X autofocus system is the same as the acclaimed Nikon D3, which has become the preferred choice of so many of the world's leading sports and news photographers by delivering tack-sharp images, even when shooting moving, low-contrast or poorly lit subjects.",

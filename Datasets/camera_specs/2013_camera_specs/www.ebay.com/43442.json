    "product information": "Real Photo Technology captures treasured moments just as your eye sees them. Combining the new RPII Processor, 5th Generation Super CCD-HR Sensor and Fujinon Lens Optics, the Z3 delivers ultra-high sensitivity with low noise, faster operational speeds and reduced power consumption. This allows you to capture priceless memories as photographs with every nuance of light and color, even in low light situations without a flash.Z3 features an innovative Non-extending, refractive optical zoom for faster start-up and a new Fujinon lens design. Superior optics collects light and precisely form the image in conjunction with a 5th Generation Super CCD-HR. Bring your subject closer to you with a 3.0x Optical Zoom (equivalent to a 36-108mm on a 35mm camera). Increase your photo capture ability by utilizing the 5.7x Digital Zoom for a combined 17.1x Total Zoom range.By simply touching the Picture Stabilization button, the Z3 will automate professional photographic techniques to help reduce camera shake, freeze subject movement and improve low light background detail. Picture Stabilization utilizes higher sensitivities, up to ISO 1600 in the Z3, an incredibly high signal to noise ratio, and faster shutter and operational speeds, to deliver virtually blur free images where conventional digital cameras cannot. Life's a blur...your pictures shouldn't be. Picture Stabilization is that simple, and your camera remains ultra-fast so you never miss a shot.Just select \"Natural Light\" mode, and the Z3 will automatically suppress the flash and adjust sensitivity up to ISO 1600 to compensate for low-light situations, letting you easily take photos in a variety of indoor or outdoor situations and capture the image in full detail just as your eye sees it... without a flash. And, speaking of flash, the Z3 has incorporated Fujifim's Intelligent Flash System or i-Flash. i-Flash fine-tunes flash output for shooting with high sensitivity settings. It recognizes scene conditions and determines the optimum flash output to ensure superb results. Subjects in the foreground appear natural, and background detail is bright and clear. The difference is especially noticeable in the natural facial tones of people in your pictures, in close-ups and group photos alike. A scratch resistant, reinforced acrylic protective shield protects the Z3's 2.5-inch LCD so you can take it everywhere. The extra-large LCD makes it easy to frame your photos and share the results in brilliant color. Sensing ambient light, the LCD automatically adjusts brightness for optimum viewing indoors or outdoors. Manual control provides additional brightness. Post shot interfaces make it easier to view and share photos right on screen.The Z3 features a stylish, ultra-compact contemporary design that is ergonomically engineered for finger-tip control. Zoom in or out, or change modes all with the touch of a finger for convenient one hand operation so you don't miss any photographic opportunity. The new programming menu is intuitive and uses drop down lists that expand to make your selections simple and quick. And, with 14 pre-programmed scene position modes, including the new Dual Shot mode, taking beautiful pictures has never been easier.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandFujifilm ModelZ3 MPNZ3 UPC74101407334, 840356283135\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom3x Digital Zoom6x Sensor Resolution5.1 MP Screen Size2.5\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5\" Sensor TypeSuper CCD HR\nLens System Macro Focus Range8-80cm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera36 - 108mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/1000 sec Min Shutter Speed4 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringMulti-Segment Exposure ModesAutomatic, Program Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 1600, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 64, ISO 800, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max1600\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.3 m - 3 m Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Integrated Memory size10 MB Supported Flash MemoryxD-Picture Card, xD-Picture Card Type H, xD-Picture Card Type M Floppy Drive StorageNone\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeNone\nDimensions Depth0.8 in.

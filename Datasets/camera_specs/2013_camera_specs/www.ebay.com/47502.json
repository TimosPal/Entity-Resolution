    "hdrart": "Casio's exclusive HDR-Art creates an artistic approach to photography that combines a burst of CS images recorded at the touch of the shutter button. The camera automatically processes the images, slightly adjusting the relative strength of contrast in local areas. The resulting image achieves a level of expression that normally cannot be realized without mounting the camera on a tripod, shooting a series of images with different exposures, and then processing the images on a computer.",
    "highdynamic range hdr technology": "HDR (High-Dynamic Range) harnesses the High-Speed CS and high-speed large-volume image data processing capabilities of the Exilim Engine HS to create a type of digital imaging. The process combines information from a burst of multiple images and unites the most detailed portions of each image (taken at different exposures) for a beautiful, never-before-possible wide dynamic range.",
    "highspeed sr zoom": "High-Speed Super Resolution zoom, enables clear multiple-magnification zoom without the need for an optical zoom.

    "convenient features": "When traveling on an exotic adventure, you can't afford missed photo opportunities. You'll find Nikon's Motion Detection feature to be important because it identifies moving objects and automatically adjusts shutter speed and ISO to assure crisp, blur free images. ISO speeds up to 3200 will help you capture great shots in low-light. Blinking eyes and red-eye can ruin portraits. That's why the Coolpix S9100 includes blink warning. It also offers in-camera red-eye fix that automatically corrects red-eye as you shoot and skin softening that smoothes skin tones. The Coolpix S9100 also has macro shooting for shooting as close as 1.6-inch.",

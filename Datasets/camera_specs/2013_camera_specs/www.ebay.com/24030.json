    "product information": "A digital compact camera offering powerful imaging performance, easy operation and outstanding battery life, the COOLPIX L6 lets users shoot with greater confidence for better-looking results.Created with a slim, lightweight design, the COOLPIX L6 offers the imaging performance of 6.0 effective megapixels. It also has an optical 3x Zoom-Nikkor lens with a focal range of 38-116mm (35mm equivalent) - making it a cinch to capture everything from pleasing portraits to expansive landscapes with true-to-life color and fine detail. Furthermore, the COOLPIX L6 delivers the world's longest battery life - being able to shoot up to an incredible 1000 images when using the supplied Energizer lithium AA-size batteries! Highly convenient, such extended battery life is ideally suited to travel or when capturing important events, such as a wedding, where you can't afford to run out of power.The COOLPIX L6 offers light sensitivity beyond conventional compact digitals, too, with settings up to ISO 800. This means users can shoot pictures in lower light without having to use a long exposure. It also allows users to select higher shutter speeds for the capture of fast-moving subjects. And because the COOLPIX L6 has a large, easy-to-view 115.000-dot 2.5-inch LCD monitor, it supports smooth composition as well as enjoyable image playback anywhere.A choice of 15 Scene modes makes it easy to achieve optimal results in a wide range of common shooting conditions. Simply select the Scene mode most closely corresponding to the scene at hand and the COOLPIX L6 automatically chooses the best settings for pleasing results. Four of these handy Scene modes also feature Scene assist, which helps users to achieve better composition.The COOLPIX L6 also makes it especially easy to get great-looking results in challenging conditions by featuring three unique in-camera Nikon image innovations - Face Priority AF that automatically detects and achieves sharp focus on people's faces wherever they are in the frame, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix that can automatically overcome the red-eye effect sometimes caused by flash, and Nikon's D-Lighting that can rescue underexposed images or shots taken with too much back light.The COOLPIX L6 additionally features approximately 23MB of internal memory, which allows users to go on shooting even without external memory media. It's also compatible with SD cards, which are widely available around the world. What's more, the COOLPIX L6 even adds convenience to printing - allowing users to connect the camera direct to PictBridge-compatible printers to produce beautiful photos without the need for a computer.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandNikon ModelL6 MPN25551-BUN UPC018208255511\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom3x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution6.0 MP Screen Size2.5\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range10cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Manual Focus, Automatic Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera38 - 116mm\nExposure Exposure MeteringMatrix Exposure ModesAutomatic, Program Light Sensitivity Max800\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.3 m - 5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAuto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash, Slow Sync Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Integrated Memory size23 MB Supported Flash MemoryCompactFlash Card Type I, SD Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeNone, Optical\nDimensions Depth3.3 in.

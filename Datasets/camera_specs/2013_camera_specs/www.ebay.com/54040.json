    "categorybrand": "Canon EOS 7D Mark II Digital SLR Camera + EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens Kit\nOVERVIEWFEATURESDesigned with a penchant for speed, the EOS 7D Mark II DSLR Camera from Canon is characterized by its APS-C-sized 20.2MP CMOS sensor, dual DIGIC 6 image processors, and a top continuous shooting rate of 10 fps. Both a 65-point all cross-type phase-detection AF system and Dual Pixel CMOS AF technology benefit fast, accurate focusing performance for both optical viewfinder and live view shooting. Additionally, the combination of the dual image processors along with the CMOS sensor also contribute to enhanced low-light sensitivity to a native ISO 16000, which is further expandable to ISO 51200. The 7D Mark II comfortably performs in a range of challenging situations, and while ideally situated as a tool for sports and wildlife photographers, it resides equally as well in the hands of contemporary multimedia image-makers.\nIncluded with the 7D Mark II is the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens, which provides a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 28.8-216mm. Covering a range of perspectives from wide-angle to telephoto-length, this lens is a highly versatile tool for use in everyday situations for both still image and movie recording. Its design integrates an STM stepping motor that provides near-silent focusing abilities with smooth and precise control. Additionally, the optical image stabilization system helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake by up to four shutter speed steps in order to benefit working in low-light conditions and with greater zoom magnifications. One PMO (precision molded optics) aspherical lens element and one UD (ultra-low dispersion) element are also incorporated into the lens construction to help reduce chromatic aberrations throughout the zoom range and an optimized lens coating has been applied, too, in order to lessen lens flare and ghosting for higher contrast, clearer imagery.20.2MP APS-C CMOS Sensor\nDual DIGIC 6 Image Processors\n3.0\" 1.04m-Dot Clear View II LCD Monitor\nFull HD 1080p/60 Video & Movie Servo AF\nDual Pixel CMOS AF with Live View\n65-Point All Cross-Type AF System\nNative ISO 16000, Extended to ISO 51200\nContinuous 10 fps Shooting\nMagnesium Alloy Body Construction\nBuilt-In GPS Receiver & Digital Compass\nINSIDE THE PACKAGECanon EOS 7D Mark II Digital SLR Camera + EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM Lens Kit * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.

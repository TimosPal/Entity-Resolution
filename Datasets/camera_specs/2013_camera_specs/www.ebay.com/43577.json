    "28mm wideangle lens with 10x optical zoom": "Now you can fit sweeping landscapes into a single frame with the 28mm wide-angle setting, and pull in subjects from far away to capture even subtle facial expressions with the dynamic 280mm telephoto setting. Ideal for traveling, this camera combines this wide ranging lens with a handy, compact body. The extra optical zoom function also extends the zoom to as much as 15x, giving you even greater telephoto power.",
    "28mm wideangle with multiple aspect ratios": "Conventional cameras generally use almost the entire CCD area when recording an image, and the angle of view may be altered by changing aspect ratio. The CCD of TZ3 provides a larger recording area, making it possible to capture images from 28mm to 280mm with any of three aspect ratios - 4:3, 3:2 or 16:9.",

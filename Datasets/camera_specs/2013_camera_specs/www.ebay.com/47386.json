It combines a 20.3 MP APS-C CMOS sensor, with the DRIMeIV image processor to deliver high-quality imagery, 9 fps burst shooting, and Full HD 1080/60p video capability. A standard ISO sensitivity range of 100-25600 allows you to shoot photos in extreme low-light conditions.\nThe electronic viewfinder is tiltable 80\u00c2\u00b0 upwards, which will enable you to shoot at low angles while still looking through the viewfinder. For an alternate viewing method, menu navigation, or to review your shots, the NX30 has a 3\" AMOLED touch display. With a 720 x 480 resolution, and 1,037k dots, the display can swivel horizontally 180\u00c2\u00b0 while rotating vertically 270\u00c2\u00b0.\nIntuitive sharing features such as Tag & Go, Photo Beam, and MobileLink are made easy with the NX30's built-in NFC and Wi-Fi capabilities. You can instantly share your photos through Dropbox, and AutoShare. Remote Viewfinder Pro allows you to control your camera remotely from your smart device.\nThe included 18-55mm lens features Samsung's i-Function technology, which puts a button on the lens that unlocks the manual adjustment of several settings. Choose from the shutter speed, aperture, exposure value, white balance, and ISO, and then turn the ring on the lens to adjust your selected parameter. Optical image stabilizer and fast autofocus help deliver clear, sharp imagery.\n20.3 MP APS-C CMOS Sensor\nDRIMeIV Image Processor\nHigh Speed 9 fps Capture\nFull HD 1080/60p Video with Stereo Audio\nISO 100-25600\nTiltable Electronic Viewfinder\n3\" Tiltable AMOLED Touch Display\nWi-Fi & NFC Smart Connectivity\n18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS Lens\nIncludes Photoshop Lightroom 5\nINSIDE THE PACKAGESamsung NX30 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS Lens * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.

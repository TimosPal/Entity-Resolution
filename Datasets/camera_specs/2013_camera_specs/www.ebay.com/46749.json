    "4x antiblur": "4x anti-blur automatically counters blurred images in four different ways. Lens-shift VR (Vibration Reduction) reduces the effect of camera shake. High ISO (up to 3200 at full size) light sensitivity reduces the risk of blurred images with fast-moving subjects or in low-light. Advanced motion detection compensates for camera and subject movement. Best Shot Selector (BSS) automatically selects the sharpest of up to 10 sequential shots.",

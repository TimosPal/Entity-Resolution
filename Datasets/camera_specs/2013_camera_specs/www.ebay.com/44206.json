The shutter fires at a blazing speed - up to 15 shots per second continuously - so you can freeze even the fastest moving subjects.",

But imagine being able to slow down an important moment - to see live action in slow motion. With the Nikon 1 J3 camera's amazing Slow View mode, that's exactly what happens. Slow down what you're seeing on the LCD, and then select the shot you want. Combine that with smart photo selector, which fires 20 shots with a single shutter press and select the best five for you, and you've got every advantage for catching those once-in-a-lifetime moments.",

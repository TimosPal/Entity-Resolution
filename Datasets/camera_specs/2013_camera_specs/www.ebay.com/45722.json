    "fullframe 24 x 36 mm capture without any compromises": "The combination of an extremely high-resolution sensor, high performance M lenses and careful processing of the digital picture data provides the best picture results under all conditions. The CCD sensor in the LEICA M9 with 18 million pixels, allows the utilization of the full 35 mm format. The sensor of the M9 uses a newly developed cover glass to eliminate infrared light contamination and allows the utilization of existing Leica M lenses without loss of image quality. The use of external UV/IR filters is not required.",
    "intuitive controls": "The simple handling and menus of the LEICA M9 allow the photographer to concentrate on taking pictures, not the controls. The key control element of the M9 is an intuitive four-way switch and dial combination used in conjunction with the 2.5-inch LCD monitor on the back. To set the ISO sensitivity, simply maintain light pressure on the ISO button while simultaneously turning the dial to select the required setting. All other functions important for everyday situations are quickly and easily accessible by pressing the set button - white balance, image-data compression, resolution, exposure correction, exposure bracketing, and programmable user profiles. The user profiles can be programmed with any combination of camera and shooting settings, stored under an assigned name, and accessed quickly whenever required for a particular situation.",

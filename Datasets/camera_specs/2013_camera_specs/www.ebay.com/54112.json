    "memories that move  and move you": "Sometimes a still picture can't preserve a memory like a moving image. School plays. Piano recitals. A child's first words. For moments like these, the Coolpix L24 shoots TV quality movies - complete with sound - at 30 fps with 640 x 480 resolution. It's never been simpler to capture life's most special moments, and it's never been easier to relive them because you can watch them on the camera's LCD, your TV, or your home computer screen.",

    "powerful affordable unbeatable": "The palm-sized Coolpix L24 is as powerful as it is affordable. It boasts 14-megapixel recording for razor-sharp photos that will retain their detail on prints as large as 16 x 20 inches. Plus, a 3.6x optical Zoom-NIKKOR glass lens features a zoom range from 37 mm to 134 mm, so you can capture an entire graduation class as easily as you can your favorite graduate. The Coolpix L24 makes it a breeze to shoot quality photos and movies. It has a bright three-inch LCD so it's easy to see the screen, shoot your picture, and share it with friends. Its three-way Vibration Reduction (VR) Image Stabilization System minimizes the streaky images that result from shots taken with shaky hands. Its motion detector identifies moving subjects and then adjusts the camera's settings to catch the action, so you're sure to capture a sandlot player's game-saving catch or first bike ride.",

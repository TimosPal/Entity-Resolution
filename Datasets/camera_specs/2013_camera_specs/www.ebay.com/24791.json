    "description": "The Alpine SPS-170A car speaker is a moderate-power, two-way vehicle speaker ready to produce high and mid-range sounds via the tweeter and mid-range speaker. The Alpine car speaker can supply up to 40 watts of RMS power and 200 watts of peak handling power. As a non-powered speaker, the two-way car speaker relies on an external power source to create the high and mid-range sounds intended to come from this unit. The 6.75-inch Alpine car speaker has a 4-Ohm dual-coil impedance and a 92 dB sensitivity. The unit consists of a metal woofer, rubber surround, and neodymium magnet. The unit is a non-enclosed speaker, meaning that it does not come preset in a speaker box. It must be set in a box as a standalone speaker or as part of a speaker set. The Alpine car speaker requires a top mounting depth of 2.25 inches and a mounting hole size of 4.92 inches. This means the box will need a back-to-front clearance greater than 2.25 inches and a hole diameter of 4.92 inches for the speaker to sit correctly. The Alpine SPS-170A car speaker uses a minimum frequency response of 35 Hz and a maximum frequency response of 30 kHz. The two-way car speaker has a 6.5-inch woofer and 0.5-inch tweeter.\nProduct Identifiers BrandAlpine ModelSPS-170A MPNSPS-170A UPC793276600943\nKey Features Car Speaker FunctionMid-Range Speaker, Tweeter Size6.75\" TypeCoaxial Elements2-Way PoweredNon-Powered RMS Power40 W\nTechnical Features Min Frequency Response35 Hz Max Frequency Response30 kHz Impedance4 ohm Sensitivity92 dB Peak Power Handling200 watt\nMounting Top Mounting Depth2.25 in.

    "fast super bright f18 izuiko 4x wide lens": "The iZuiko f/1.8-2.5 6.0-24mm (28-112mm equivalent angle of view in 35mm cameras) digital lens is the 4x compact version of the legendary, high-quality Zuiko digital lenses featured with Olympus DSLRs. With a minimum aperture of f/1.8 at wide-angle and a maximum aperture of f/2.5 at telephoto, this lens assures fast shutter speeds for sharp low-light images. This aperture range also allows photographers to take portraits that highlight the subject by defocusing the background, a capability not possible in most compact cameras. The lens is specifically designed for clear, high-quality photographic performance with minimal ghosting or flare.",
    "high sensitivity ccd": "Compared to existing 1/2.33-inch, 14-megapixel CCDs, the light-reception area of each pixel of the 1/1.63-inch, 10-megapixel CCD featured in the XZ-1 has been doubled. Superb, low-noise images can be shot even in dimly lit situations such as night scenes and indoor shots.",
    "lowlight performance": "The XZ-1 has an easily accessible built-in pop-up flash to illuminate low-light subjects, reduce red-eye and fill in dark areas. The camera also features an AF illuminator to make it simple to focus in low-light situations. Additionally, dual image stabilization further assures you'll get the shot you want while holding the camera: mechanical sensor-shift image stabilization compensates for camera movement in low-light conditions when shutter speeds are slower while digital image stabilization freezes the action with high ISO sensitivity and fast shutter speeds that prevent blurry images often caused by a moving subject. On top of all this, the XZ-1 also offers a low-light mode which automatically adjusts the ISO sensitivity up to ISO 3200 to take sharp full-resolution photos in dark places.",

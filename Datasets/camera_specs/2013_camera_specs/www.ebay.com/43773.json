    "digic 4 image processor": "Canon's most advanced image processor, DIGIC 4, delivers evolved Face Detection technology that keeps every face in every photo looking its very best.

In addition, exposure, flash and white balance are compensated, so that faces exhibit natural skin tones and backgrounds are properly exposed.",

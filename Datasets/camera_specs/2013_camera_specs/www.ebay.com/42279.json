    "product information": "Taking good pictures doesn't have to be difficult. The new Canon PowerShot S300 goes where no digital camera has gone before. This Digital ELPH has greater zoom power, more life-like color reproduction, movie clip recording, and even its own little printer. You'll still find the ease of operation, superior features, and unique quality that you trust with Canon PowerShot S300 Digital ELPH.The stainless steel-bodied S300 defines luxury and sophistication. Its ultra-compact design employs the latest optical technology. In fact, Powershot S300 is the world's smallest digital camera with a retractable, optical 3x zoom lens. The more powerful light guide flash, the new digital signal processing IC/CPU, and LCD monitor run more efficiently, requiring only a compact Li-Ion battery. This all boils down to a camera that's stronger, smarter, faster, yet more compact. You want your pictures to look their best, right? Well, quality pays. Canon technology gives the S300 a 1/2.7 inch type, 2.11 megapixel CCD, able to record a 1600x1200 pixel image. That's the resolution you need for a high-quality 8\"x10\" (20cm x 25cm) print. A new design for the ultra-compact and fully retractable zoom lens offers high resolution and low distortion. Used with the IC processing signal, the digital zoom smoothly engages to fill your frame with detailed, clear images up to the equivalent of a 265mm lens for 35mm format cameras. There's a macro mode, too; so, take pictures from far and wide, tight and close. Connect the cable to the optional Canon CP-10 Card Photo printer, put S300 into direct print mode, and you're there. With a resolution of 300x300 dpi, you'll get brilliant credit card-sized prints. Pick your preferred print settings, and you'll have the prints in mere seconds. With the new digital signal processing IC working in conjunction with the primary color filter, Powershot S300 ensures that each photo shows its true colors, in every shooting situation. Canon advances in technology provide improvements governing optimum exposure, resolution, and color temperatures to virtually guarantee accuracy with the AE control system and various white-balance settings (6 total including black-and-white). Different situations demand their own needs. S300 offers nine different image quality combinations. For best results, select Superfine mode to lower the compression ratio and hold onto image detail sufficient for business purposes. Sometimes you want more than one shot. Record a movie clip to see every frame of that game-winning goal or basket. S300 can record movie clips at 20 frames per second in three pixel modes, for up to 30 seconds, maximum. They even have sound! The movie clip is saved as an AVI file for you to keep. Play it back on your LCD monitor, your TV or your computer.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelDigital ELPH S300 / Digital IXUS 300 MPN6742A002\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom3x Digital Zoom2.5x Sensor Resolution2.0 MP Screen Size1.5\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.7\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range16-76cm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic Auto Focus typeActive, TTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera35 - 105mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/1500 sec Min Shutter Speed1 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative Exposure ModesAutomatic, Manual, Program Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 150 Light Sensitivity Max100\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.26 m - 3.5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAuto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash, Slow Sync Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, Flash ON Mode, Night Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryCompactFlash Card Type I, CompactFlash I Floppy Drive StorageNone\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeOptical Optical Viewfinder TypeReal-image zoom\nDimensions Depth1.2 in.

    "dual image stabilization": "The Advanced Dual Image Stabilization (IS) feature allows you to capture crystal-clear, blur-free shots without using a flash or tripod. The TL210's Advanced Dual IS combines both Optical and Digital Image Stabilizers to produce sharp images without the noise commonly found in other cameras. The optical IS compensates for hand trembling by shifting the lens in the opposite direction. When using Optical IS isn't quite enough, the Digital IS automatically takes over to ensure blur-free images.",
    "hd movies": "Record movies in the palm of your hand. The CL80 is like having a compact HD video camera that also takes professional-grade photos. You can record HD video in 1280 x 720p resolution at 30 frames per second. The H.264 format also allows you to record twice as much as an MP4 and four times more than an MJPEG - the format used in many other digital cameras - and delivers a much higher video and sound quality.",

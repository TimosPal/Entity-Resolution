    "product information": "Positioned the top of Nikon's COOLPIX lineup, the COOLPIX 5400 is a compact, lightweight digital still camera with 5.1 effective megapixels and a powerful 4x zoom lens. It delivers superior image quality - the hallmark of Nikon products - and features advanced ergonomics, which greatly enhance operational ease and comfort. The camera targets primarily users who demand the same degree of creative capability afforded by an SLR, will settle for nothing less than the best digital camera on the market, and will not compromise when it comes to image quality. The COOLPIX 5400 also suits film-camera users who wish to take advantage of the impressive array of accessories available, to further extend their photographic potential. Any user in search of an extremely versatile, high-quality digital still camera will find the COOLPIX 5400 to be an exciting camera loaded with possibilities. Nikon's newly developed 4x Zoom-Nikkor lens, with its professional-quality 5.8-24mm (equivalent to 28-116mm in 35mm [135] camera format) focal range, offers outstanding optical performance thanks to the incorporation of an ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lens element to minimize chromatic aberration, and two ASP (aspherical) lenses for reduced distortion. Combined with the COOLPIX 5400's 5.1 effective megapixels, they virtually ensure remarkably clear, colorful images with excellent contrast. Nikon has equipped the COOLPIX 5400 with the all-new, highly functional Mode dial, which allows users to directly select exposure modes and set various shooting parameters. The Mode dial works in conjunction with the Command dial and the center-click Multi selector to make camera setting a surprisingly simple task - giving users the freedom to focus on capturing the images they want. The camera incorporates four exposure modes: Programmed Auto [P], Shutter-Priority Auto [S], Aperture-Priority Auto [A] and Manual [M] combine to give you the greatest degree of creative control possible. The COOLPIX 5400 also offers [AUTO] mode, in which the camera automatically performs settings and gives users high-quality point-and-shoot capability. And for striking images in practically any situation, the new COOLPIX features 15 versatile [SCENE] Modes - simply select the mode appropriate for the prevailing conditions, and characteristics such as exposure, focus, flash, contrast, sensitivity and white balance are automatically adjusted by the camera. The COOLPIX 5400 features many advanced digital controls - the new AE-BSS (Auto Exposure-Best Shot Selector) mode, Noise Reduction mode, Saturation Control and White Balance Bracketing among them - which are highly valuable in obtaining optimum image quality. Multiple capture modes receive considerable support from the large 64MB buffer memory, which enables the capture of up to 7 full-size (2, 592 x 1, 944-pixel) pictures at 3 frames per second (fps). To help ensure you don't miss those unexpected or fleeting moments, the COOLPIX 5400 incorporates the new 5 shot buffer mode. And the versatility of the camera is further enhanced by handy, innovative features such as movies with audio and the new Time-lapse movie mode, ideal for observational recording. The newest member of the COOLPIX family offers increased visibility even during daylight photography thanks to the new highly transmissible Vari-angle LCD monitor. And the compact, lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloy body has been designed for maximum durability and portability, and affords a secure, comfortable grip for stability during shooting. All essential accessories are supplied with the COOLPIX 5400 - a battery and charger, a CompactFlash Card, an A/V cable, a USB cable and the comprehensive Nikon View software package. The camera is also compatible with a host of optional accessories, including wideangle and telephoto converters and a newly designed fisheye converter. And the COOLPIX 5400's accessory shoe accommodates a number of Nikon's external Speedlights.

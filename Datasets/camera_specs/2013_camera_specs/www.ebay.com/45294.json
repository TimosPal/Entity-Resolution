    "product information": "The PEN E-PL2 continues the PEN family's legacy of a small, light and simple design, intuitive interface and DSLR image quality and expands your creative potential with lens technology, live guide, in-camera creative features, auxiliary lenses, a close-up spotlight accessory for macro photography and the Olympus PENPAL Bluetooth accessory. And the newly designed E-PL2's ergonomic body makes capturing amazing still images and HD video more fun than ever before. The E-PL2 comes with the Movie and Still Compatible (MSC) ED m14-42mm f3.5/5.6 zoom lens. This kit lens has a smooth, silent and quick inner focus mechanism to make it exceptionally fast and nearly silent when recording high-definition movie.The PEN E-PL2's live guide system takes the guesswork out of great photography and videography by allowing you to preview effects at the touch of a button. Want more vivid or muted color in your shot? Want warmer or cooler color? Want a brighter or darker subject, or a sharper or softer background? Simply select live guide and turn the wheel on the back of the camera to slide through numerous photographic and videographic effects. Make adjustments and watch the LCD as the effects are made live - before the image is captured!The E-PL2 provides an overall excellent user experience with a large, easy-to-view 3.0-inch 460,000-dot high-resolution LCD monitor and a control dial. Olympus appreciates that you may not have hours to spend retouching your images on the computer. The E-PL2 has improved art filters with art filter variations that allow users to customize each filter with different moods and effects and an art effect function to add various composition effects to the picture. Six art filters are incorporated including the dramatic tone filter. With the E-PL2's multiple exposure you can shoot one shot, then another and combine them in real time, or capture both shots separately and combine them within the camera later. At the heart of the E-PL2 is a large-size image sensor. This big sensor is inside the much smaller body of the E-PL2. This high-performance 12.3-megapixel live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range, accurate color fidelity, and state-of-the-art technology to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas.Recording HD movies with the E-PL2 is simple thanks to an easy-to-reach one-touch record button on the back of the camera body. If you're about to snap a photo and you realize a video would capture the spirit of the scene even better, simply press the record button and instantly you're capturing videos! Easily toggle back and forth between capturing stills and video by using your index finger to press the shutter button or your thumb to press the red record button. Having the ability to shoot still images and videos opens up a world of imaging possibilities.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandOlympus ModelE-PL2 MPN262901 UPC050332176935\nKey Features Camera TypeMirrorless Interchangeable Lens Optical Zoom3x Sensor Resolution12.3 MP Screen Size3\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size13.0 x 17.3mm Sensor TypeHigh speed Live MOS\nLens System Lens TypeZoom lens Lens For SD14mm-42mm Focal Length Range14mm - 42mm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic, Manual Lens Filter Size37 mm Lens System FeaturesAspherical Lens, ED Glass Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Lens Construction7 group(s) / 8 element(s) Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera28 - 84mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/4000 sec Min Shutter Speed60 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b13 EV range, in 1, 1/2 or 1/3 EV steps Exposure RangeEV 0-20 ( ISO 100 ) Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Multi-Segment, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Bulb, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 200-6400, ISO auto (200-6400) Light Sensitivity Max6400\nCamera Flash Flash TypePop-up Flash Red Eye ReductionYes Camera Flash FeaturesFlash +/- Compensation, Wireless Off-Camera Control Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Rear Curtain Sync, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemorySD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card, SDXC Memory Card\nDimensions Depth1.7 in.

    "shoot in low light mode for dimlylit situations": "With an ISO of 400-6400, the low light mode takes the Canon PowerShot SD1300 IS boldly into the shadows! Now even scenes notorious for having insufficient light, such as those lit by candles, fire, or street lamp, come through in fantastic color and clarity, with less noise, you can keep the feel of the scene intact without adding additional light, so the result will be scenes with the visual accuracy, depth and clarity you expect from a Canon camera.",

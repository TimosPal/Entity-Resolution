    "easier to share": "The SP-600UZ truly bridges the gap between taking and sharing photos. When it's time to admire your handiwork or show off to friends, explore your archive using the photo surfing tool. You can even surf from one picture to the next in high definition quality on HDMI compatible HDTVs. The sheer variety of SP series features lets you take your very best shots, for example AF tracking follows your subject even when in motion, and i-Auto identifies your shooting environment, automatically adjusting your camera settings.",

These powerful sensors are optimized to work perfectly with the zoom lenses, ensuring all the detail in a scene is captured with exceptional clarity. To assist in low-light situations or when shooting handheld, these SL-series offer a maximum ISO rating of ISO 6400 for maximizing available light and ensuring that shutter speeds are fast enough to capture action without blurring. Sensor-shift digital image stabilization is offered by both devices and applies the latest in image enhancing processes to bring out detail and preserve the finer points of a picture.",

The zoom ranges make these cameras ideal for travelers looking to record their adventures, sports fans keen to capture their teams on camera or any photographer looking for a step-up from their current bridge camera. Plus, with a close-focus distance of 2 cm, users can also pick out precise close-up details, too. These zoom lenses offer for smooth zooming and precise framing of scenes, and an additional zoom lever on the barrel of the lens gives users the ability to zoom in and out without taking their hands from the camera - guaranteeing that they'll never miss their desired shot.",
    "professional look and feel": "These SL-series has cosmetic features and design flourishes that are strongly reminiscent of DSLRs and other pro-level cameras. These have been designed with a rubberized coating to make them comfortable in the hands for extended shooting sessions, but also offer the reassuring build quality expected from a premium camera. The cameras' buttons are ergonomically located and the metal-like finish completes the overall appeal - either will delight both the beginner and the enthusiast photographer.",

The SL-series also have electronic viewfinders (EVF) that offer the 200,000 dots screens, so users can be assured that they're seeing a good representation of what the camera will capture as a still image or movie. The EVF also now benefit from the addition of a diopter adjustment, making it much easier for spectacle wearers to look through the viewfinder.",

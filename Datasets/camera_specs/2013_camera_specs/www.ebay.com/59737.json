    "4x optical zoom lens with folded optics technology": "The DMC-FP3 features a 4x optical zoom Lumix DC Vario lens (35mm camera equivalent: 35-140mm). The folded optics of the shaft guide method is adopted to secure the toughness of the lens unit. Comprising 11 elements and a prism unit in 10 groups, including an ED (Extra Low Dispersion) lens and 4 aspherical lenses with 7 aspherical surfaces, this advanced lens unit renders high resolution image corner to corner even adopting the folded optics.",
    "4x optical zoomup to 84x extra optical zoom": "The DMC-FP3 is equipped with a 4x optical zoom lens (35mm camera equivalent: 35-140mm). The extra optical zoom function uses the center part of the CCD to extend this 4x zoom ratio to powerful 8.4x zoom (35mm camera equivalent: 295mm) at a resolution of 3-megapixel or less. Adding the extra optical zoom to the 4x digital zoom 2 extends the total zooming power to a maximum of 33.8x.",

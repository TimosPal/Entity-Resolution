    "intuitive manual control and creative option": "The excellent manual controllability is an advantage of DMC-FZ40, making it stand out against standard compact cameras. The adopted jog dial enhances the operability together with the focus button on the back of the camera. In movie recording, the DMC-FZ40 goes further than simply recording HD movies. Apart from the movie recording capability of conventional digital compact cameras, the DMC-FZ40 also features a Creative Movie mode, which lets the user set the shutter speed and aperture manually to make even more impressive movies. Changing the shutter speed brings special effects to movies, which is especially suitable for shooting fast-moving subject. The ability to control the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at different distances and it is desired to have each of them stand out.",

    "large aperture f20 24mm wideangle": "Another major upgrade to the DMC-LX3S is the F2.0 24mm ultra wide-angle Leica DC Vario-Summicron lens. The F2.0 is about twice as bright as a F2.8 lens and can shoot at higher shutter speeds to capture clear, blur-free images in dimly lit environments. In addition, the 24mm lens captures approximately a 213% larger viewing angle than a normal 35mm camera and 136% larger compared to a 28mm wide-angle lens. The lens unit consists of eight elements in six groups with four aspherical lenses with four aspherical surfaces. As a result of the F2.0 lens, the DMC-LX3S produces high resolution and minimal distortion and artifacts such as chromatic aberrations, ghosting and flaring.",

    "shooting functions that invite creativity": "The DMC-LX3S features a Film mode with six color types and three types of monochrome selections. Much like selecting from different film types, this function gives you the flexibility and creative freedom to take more expressive digital photos. Also, when using the multi-film mode, the DMC-LX3S produces a maximum of three images from a RAW file for you to compare the different textures. Another feature is the multiple-exposure feature, which lets you create artistic photos by overlaying up to three consecutive images; while still viewing the last image on the 3.0-inch LCD screen. The LCD on the DMC-LX3S is improved with a 460,000-dot high resolution.",

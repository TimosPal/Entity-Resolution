Or get a front-row view of the school play\u2014from any seat in the house. The Samsung WB2100 Camera\u2019s 35x optical zoom telephoto lens delivers crisp detail and sharp focus every time, putting you in the middle of the action no matter where it\u2019s happening.\n3\u201d Tilt LCD Screen:\nSee life from a whole new angle and add excitement to your images. The Samsung WB2100 Camera\u2019s 3.0\"(75mm) Tilt Display offers a full 135-degree range of motion. So now you can easily frame and capture a low-angle image from the best position\u2014or even hold the camera over a crowd and still see exactly what you\u2019re getting.\nLow light Shot:\nShow your subject in the best possible light\u2014in moonlight, candlelight, or practically no light at all. Low-Light Shot mode takes three continuous shots, and then merges them all into one clear, bright image with minimal blur or noise.\n16MP CMS Sensor:\nTrust your equipment and shoot with confidence. The super-fast, super-sensitive 16-megapixel BSI (back side\u2013illuminated) CMOS sensor needs less light for proper exposure and quicker focus than conventional sensors. So even if a moment happens in a heartbeat, or is lit only by the reflected glow of the moon, with the Samsung WB2100 Camera, your photos will be sure to match your memories.\nOptical Image Stabilization:\nThe Samsung WB2100 Camera\u2019s Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) gives your images crisp focus, even if you\u2019re not perfectly still. Shoot with confidence in any condition to experience photos that come out sharp and clear\u2014in low-light situations, when zooming in for a shot, or while you\u2019re on the move.\nPanorama Shot:\nDon\u2019t be limited to landscapes or group portraits when taking panoramic shots with a wide-angle lens. Simply aim the camera with the shutter pressed fully down and then release when you\u2019re ready to take the shot. Once the shots have been taken, Samsung\u2019s proprietary panoramic technology automatically searches for motion borders of the two images and stitches them together as if a professional had taken the shot.\nFull HD Recording with Movie Zoom:\nThe Samsung WB2100 Camera\u2019s 35x optical wide zoom capability delivers smooth Full HD 1080/60i video and amazing low-light performance. And Movie Zoom automatically adjusts and optimizes sound settings\u2014while eliminating motor \u201cwhir\u201d\u2014to give you crystalclear audio performance, too. And with an advanced HDMI interface, the WB2100 is one camera that works hard and plays well with others.\nRich Tone:\nCapture the blazing light and subtle depth of a sunset over water. With Rich Tone (HDR), the Samsung WB2100 Camera offers a greater range of luminance, so shadows aren\u2019t too dark and highlights aren\u2019t oversaturated. The result: perfect exposure in all areas, and vibrant details that pop.",
